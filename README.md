5. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout. 
6. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate von.

## Summary 

This program is able to be used to analyze any future or past election results that are presented in the CSV file format. 

If the commission would like to analyze voting trends within each county, the code could be modified to include gender, age, or race. The analysis would then inlude which demoraphics show up to vote in local elections. If the commision wants to continue to dig deeper, the code could continue to be modified to include the population of each county. The infromation from this would show how many people from each county turned out to vote against the total county population.
